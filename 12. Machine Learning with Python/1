a)MACHINE LEARNING - is a subset of Artificial Learning.
It consists in building a  model or an engine and giving it lots and lots of data (for example thousand pictures)
The more input data we give it the more accurate our model is going to be.

b)MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT STEPS:
1. Import the Data usually in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file
2. Clean the Data - such as remove duplicate and irrelevant data
3. Split the Data into 2 segments: Training and Testing Sets
4. Create a Model - Select an algorithm to analyze the data
5. Train the Model
6. Make Predictions- Asking is it a Cat or a Dog
7. Evaluate and Improve


c)POPULAR LIBRARIES FOR MACHINE LEARNING:
1. NumPy - it provides a multi-dimensional array

2. Pandas - a Data analysis library that provides a concept called "Data Frame" which is a two-dimensional data structure similar to an excel spreadsheet, we have rows and columns, we can select data in a row or column or a range of rows and columns

3. MatPlotLib - a two-dimensional plotting library for creating graphs and plots.

4. Scikit-Learn - which is one of the most popular machine learning libraries provides all these common algorithms like decisions, trees, neural network and so on.

d)ENVIRONMENT FOR MACHINE LEARNING PROJECTS:
Juptyter

Kaggle website - a place to do Data Scientist project
